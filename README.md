# Distributed-Weather-Data-Analysis-and-Forecasting-System

### Overview
This project involves building a distributed system for weather data analysis and forecasting. The system leverages open-source tools, cloud computing, and machine learning techniques to process and analyze large-scale weather data in real-time. The project includes data ingestion, processing, storage, and visualization, providing users with up-to-date weather forecasts and historical data analysis.

### ystem Architecture
#### Components:

###### Data Ingestion: Real-time acquisition of weather data from multiple APIs.
###### Data Processing: Using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for real-time data processing.
###### Machine Learning: Implementing models for weather forecasting.
###### Data Storage: Using a time-series database like InfluxDB.
###### Web Application: Frontend for data visualization and user interaction.
###### Deployment: Using Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
